## Future Considerations
- Consider adding a blog section for research updates and insights


- fix text color on contact page
- add image circular border to profile pic
- gscholar integration
- profile pic sizing when resizing the window
- when hovering over tabs, have a little monkey icon pop out of the corner (and/or brain)
- when hovering over the profile pic, switch between the pose and mesh pics
