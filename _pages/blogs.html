Blog topics:
On dimensionality reduction in neuroscience
Is neural decoding useful beyond BCIs?
Would dynamical systems satisfy Tinbergen?
AI and the complexity of simple organisms
Lessons from C. elegans connectomes, slime mold navigation, or insect swarms. What do “small nervous systems” teach us about scaling laws?
Why are pose estimators so brittle?
Explore dataset bias, domain generalization, and why real-world animal data breaks models trained on humans. Show how active learning, synthetic data, or multi-view constraints help.
Why evolution keeps reinventing attention
Energy efficiency in the brain vs AI compute scaling
Towards a foundation model of movement and talk about our white paper
Behavioral syllables as language
Social intelligence as the next frontier. In neuro, AI, and everything else.
Is mech interpretability useful for experimental neuroscience?
Call out kording’s microprocessor paper
What reinforcement learning gets wrong about play
ToM in non-human animals
Alternatively, if we were aliens studying humans, would we ascribe ToM?
